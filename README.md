# Playwright Automation Testing with Java 
* Playwright is an open-source automation framework designed for end-to-end testing of modern web applications. Developed by Microsoft. 
* Playwright is a Node.js library that, with a single API, automates websites and web apps running on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
* Playwright enables cross-browser, cross-platform, and cross-language testing with a unified API. It supports both headless and headed browser modes, allowing tests to run locally or in CI (prod) environments.
* Its architecture ensures fast execution and test isolation by creating a new browser context for each test, simulating a fresh browser profile.
* Playwright is distributed as a set of Maven modules. The easiest way to use it is to add one dependency to your project's pom.xml
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.playwright</groupId>
    <artifactId>playwright</artifactId>
    <version>1.53.0</version>
</dependency>
```
## Key Features 
* Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform ‚Äì works on Windows, Mac, Linux, all browsers.
* Resilient Testing - Features like auto-wait and web-first assertions reduce flaky tests by waiting for elements to be actionable before performing actions. Resilient Testing refers to writing tests that don‚Äôt easily fail just because of timing issues or small delays on the web page.
* Debugging Tool ‚Äì Playwright Inspector, Codegen, Trace Viewer.
* Automatic Browser Installation & Driver Management - Playwright handles browser binaries and driver installation seamlessly without extra configuration.
* Fast Execution & Test Isolation - Uses a persistent WebSocket connection for efficient communication with browsers and isolates tests by creating fresh browser contexts.

## Architecture
Unlike Selenium, which sends each command as an independent HTTP request to browser drivers, Playwright maintains a single persistent WebSocket connection with all browser instances. This approach reduces latency, improves reliability, and lowers failure points.
Each test runs in an isolated browser context, simulating a fresh user profile, which helps in avoiding side effects between tests and improves test stability.

### Profiling Tools After Test Execution
Once your Playwright test runs, several profiling tabs are available to analyze execution and optimize performance: <br>
<b>Tabs -</b> Flame Graph, Call Tree, Method List, Timeline, Events
* Flame Graph -> Shows which methods were called and how much time they took. The taller the flame, the more time that method consumed.
* Call Tree -> A hierarchical tree of all method calls, starting from main(). Displays how each method led to the next (who called whom).
* Method List -> A flat list of all methods called during your program run. Shows time taken and how often each method was called.
* Timeline -> A visual timeline of your application‚Äôs execution. Displays thread activity, method execution, and timings over the run duration.
* Events -> Logs key runtime events. Includes GC activity, thread switches, and any notable changes in state.

## Locators 
In Playwright, a Locator represents a way to find elements on a web page. It is a powerful abstraction that helps you locate elements efficiently and perform actions or assertions on them. Locators are designed to be resilient and smart ‚Äî they automatically wait for elements to be ready and allow easy chaining and filtering.
<br>
Using Locators, you can find elements by different strategies such as role, label, placeholder text, exact text, alt text, title attribute, test IDs, CSS selectors, XPath, and even inside Shadow DOM.

## Test Isolation
Playwright has the concept of a BrowserContext which is an in-memory isolated browser profile. It's recommended to create a new BrowserContext for each test to ensure they don't interfere with each other.
```
Browser browser = playwright.chromium().launch();
BrowserContext context = browser.newContext();
Page page = context.newPage();
```

## Playwright Trace Viewer Integration
### What is Trace Viewer 
The Playwright Trace Viewer is an advanced debugging tool that captures a full trace of your browser-based tests. It allows you to visually inspect each step of your test execution ‚Äî including clicks, inputs, navigations, DOM changes, console logs, network activity, and screenshots.
<br>
It's like a black box recorder for your test runs ‚Äî perfect for diagnosing test failures or flaky behavior.

### üéØ Why Use Trace Viewer?
üîé Visual Debugging: Inspect UI state before and after each test action. <br>
üêû Identify Flaky Tests: Detect issues caused by timing, network, or visibility problems. <br>
üì∏ Screenshots & Snapshots: View exact page states at each step. <br>
üåê Network & Console Logs: See HTTP requests, responses, and browser logs. <br>
‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Playback: Replay your test as it happened.

### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
1. Start tracing at the beginning of the test:
```
context.tracing().start(new Tracing.StartOptions()
    .setScreenshots(true)
    .setSnapshots(true)
    .setSources(true));
```
2. Execute your test as usual.
3. Stop tracing and save the trace:
```
context.tracing().stop(new Tracing.StopOptions()
    .setPath(Paths.get("trace.zip")));
```
4. Open the trace for debugging:
Via browser:
üîó <a href='https://trace.playwright.dev/'>https://trace.playwright.dev/</a> <br>
‚Üí Drag and drop your trace.zip file. By default, it's saved to the root of your project directory (or the working directory where the test runs).
